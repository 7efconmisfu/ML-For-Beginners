The Apartment is a 1960 American romantic comedy-drama film directed by Billy Wilder and starring Jack Lemmon and Shirley MacLaine. It tells the story of an insurance clerk who lets his bosses use his apartment for their affairs, hoping to get promoted, but falls in love with the elevator operator who is involved with his boss.

The film begins on November 1, 1959, when C.C. Baxter (Lemmon) is one of the thousands of employees working at Consolidated Life, an insurance company in New York City. He has a small apartment on the Upper West Side, which he lends to four of his managers - Dobisch, Kirkeby, Vanderhoff and Eichelberger - for their extramarital liaisons in exchange for favorable performance reviews. He hopes that this will help him climb the corporate ladder and get a better job. He also has a crush on Fran Kubelik (MacLaine), a charming elevator operator in the office building, but he is too shy to ask her out.

One day, Baxter is summoned to the office of the personnel director, Mr. Sheldrake (Fred MacMurray), who has heard about his apartment scheme from the four managers. Baxter thinks he is going to be promoted, but instead Sheldrake asks him to lend him his apartment for his own affair. Baxter agrees, hoping to impress Sheldrake and get ahead. He also gets two tickets to a musical show from Sheldrake as a reward. He decides to invite Fran to the show, and she accepts. However, she does not show up at the theater, because she has gone to Baxter's apartment with Sheldrake, who is her lover.

Baxter is heartbroken when he finds out that Fran is involved with Sheldrake, but he does not reveal his feelings to her. He continues to let Sheldrake use his apartment, even though it means spending many nights on the street or at his office. He also tries to befriend Fran and cheer her up, as she is unhappy with Sheldrake's empty promises of leaving his wife. On Christmas Eve, Baxter hosts a party for his office colleagues at a local bar, where he meets Fran again. He confesses his love for her and asks her to leave Sheldrake. She rejects him and goes back to Baxter's apartment with Sheldrake.

At the apartment, Fran finds out that Sheldrake has given her a $100 bill as a Christmas gift - the same gift he gave to his previous mistresses. She realizes that he does not love her and that she is wasting her life with him. She attempts suicide by taking an overdose of sleeping pills from Baxter's bathroom cabinet. Sheldrake leaves the apartment without noticing her condition and returns the key to Baxter at the office. Baxter rushes back to his apartment and finds Fran unconscious on his bed. He calls his neighbor Dr. Dreyfuss (Jack Kruschen), who lives next door and is a medical doctor, for help.
