# How to Use GradientXTerminator to Remove Gradients from Your Astrophotos
 
Gradients are a common problem in astrophotography, especially when shooting from light-polluted areas or using imperfect flat-field calibration. They can ruin the appearance of your images by creating uneven backgrounds, color casts, and loss of contrast. Fortunately, there is a powerful tool that can help you eliminate gradients from your photos in a fast and easy way: GradientXTerminator.
 
GradientXTerminator is a plug-in for Photoshop that can process 16-bit or 8-bit images, grayscale or RGB color[^1^]. It can handle large-scale gradients from light pollution, as well as vignetting and even tricky edge, corner, and circular gradients that are very hard to deal with otherwise[^1^]. It works by using sophisticated mathematics to find the optimal model of the gradient based on the input you give it[^1^]. In this article, we will show you how to use GradientXTerminator to improve your astrophotos.

## Step 1: Download and Install GradientXTerminator
 
To use GradientXTerminator, you need to have Photoshop installed on your computer. You can download a free trial version of GradientXTerminator from the official website[^2^]. You can choose between Windows or Macintosh versions, and between 32-bit or 64-bit versions depending on your operating system and Photoshop version[^2^]. After downloading the file, unzip it and run the installer. Follow the instructions to complete the installation. You will need to enter your email address to receive a license key that will activate the trial version for 30 days[^2^]. Once installed, you can access GradientXTerminator from the Filter menu in Photoshop.
 
## Step 2: Open Your Image in Photoshop
 
Open the image that you want to correct in Photoshop. Make sure it is in RGB mode (Image > Mode > RGB Color) and has a single layer (Layer > Flatten Image). If you have already done some processing on your image, such as stretching, noise reduction, or color balance, you can apply GradientXTerminator before or after those steps. However, it is recommended to apply it before any sharpening or contrast enhancement, as these may accentuate the gradients.
 
## Step 3: Select the Background Areas
 
The key to using GradientXTerminator effectively is to tell it where the background areas are in your image. You can do this by using any of the selection tools in Photoshop, such as the Lasso, Magic Wand, or Color Range tools[^1^]. You can also use multiple selections by holding down the Shift key while making them. The more background areas you select, the better GradientXTerminator will be able to model the gradient. However, you don't need to select every pixel of background; just enough to cover the different regions affected by the gradient. Avoid selecting any stars or objects in your image, as these will interfere with the gradient removal.
 
## Step 4: Run GradientXTerminator
 
With your background areas selected, go to Filter > RC-Astro > GradientXTerminator. A dialog box will appear with some options for adjusting the gradient removal. The default settings are usually good enough for most images, but you can tweak them if needed. Here is a brief explanation of what each option does:

- **Aggressiveness:** This controls how strongly GradientXTerminator tries to remove the gradient. Higher values will result in more uniform backgrounds, but may also remove some subtle details or create artifacts. Lower values will preserve more details, but may leave some residual gradients. You can use the preview window to see how different values affect your image.
- **Smoothing:** This controls how smoothly GradientXTerminator blends the corrected areas with the rest of the image. Higher values will create smoother transitions, but may also blur some edges or create halos around objects. Lower values will preserve more sharpness, but may create visible seams or patches. You can use the preview window to see how different values affect your image.
- **Balancing:** This controls how GradientXTerminator balances the 8cf37b1e13
